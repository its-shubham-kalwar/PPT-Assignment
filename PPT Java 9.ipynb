    "\n",
    "The concept of inversion of control refers to the shift of control over object creation and management \n",

    "\n",
    "The key concepts in Dependency Injection are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Dependency: A dependency is an object or service that another object relies on to fulfill its functionality.\n",

    "Constructor Injection and Setter Injection are two common approaches used in Dependency Injection \n",
    "to provide dependencies to an object. They differ in how dependencies are injected and when they \n",
    "are resolved. Here's a breakdown of the differences between the two:\n",
    "\n",
    "Constructor Injection:\n",
    "- In Constructor Injection, dependencies are provided to an object through its constructor.\n",
    "- The dependencies are typically passed as parameters to the constructor when the object is instantiated.\n",
    "- The object being instantiated must have a constructor that accepts the required dependencies as arguments.\n",
    "- The dependencies are resolved at the time of object creation, ensuring that the object is fully initialized\n",
    "with its dependencies before it is used.\n",
    "- Constructor Injection promotes the concept of immutability, as the dependencies are typically set once during\n",
    "object creation and cannot be changed afterwards.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of Constructor Injection in Java:\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public class MyClass {\n",
    "    private Dependency dependency;\n",
    "\n",
    "    public MyClass(Dependency dependency) {\n",
    "        this.dependency = dependency;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    // ...\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Setter Injection:\n",
    "- In Setter Injection, dependencies are provided to an object using setter methods.\n",
    "- The object has corresponding setter methods for each dependency it requires.\n",
    "- The dependencies are set using the setter methods after the object is instantiated.\n",
    "- Setter Injection allows for more flexibility, as dependencies can be set and changed dynamically at any point \n",
    "after the object is created.\n",
    "- Setter Injection is useful when there are optional dependencies or when the object needs to be reconfigured \n",
    "with different dependencies at runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of Setter Injection in Java:\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public class MyClass {\n",
    "    private Dependency dependency;\n",
    "\n",
    "    public void setDependency(Dependency dependency) {\n",
    "        this.dependency = dependency;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    // ...\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing between Constructor Injection and Setter Injection depends on the specific requirements of the application:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Constructor Injection is typically preferred when dependencies are mandatory and the object requires them to\n",
    "be fully initialized before it can function properly. It enforces the completeness of the object's state upon creation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Setter Injection is suitable when dependencies are optional or when the object needs to be reconfigured with \n",
    "different dependencies at runtime. It provides more flexibility in managing dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both approaches have their advantages and may be used in combination depending on the needs of the application. \n",

    "to choose the most appropriate approach for their specific use cases."

    "1. Singleton (default scope):\n",

    "   - It means that the container creates and manages a single instance of the bean throughout \n",
    "    the application.\n",
    "   - Whenever the bean is requested, the same instance is returned.\n",
    "   - Singleton-scoped beans are shared across the application, making them suitable for stateless\n",
    "    or stateful but thread-safe objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Prototype:\n",
    "   - Prototype scope creates a new instance of the bean every time it is requested from the container.\n",
    "   - It means that each time the bean is accessed, a new instance is created.\n",
    "   - Prototype-scoped beans are not shared and provide independent instances to the requesting objects.\n",
    "   - This scope is useful when you need a fresh instance of the bean each time or when the bean has state\n",
    "    that should not be shared across different parts of the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Request:\n",
    "   - Request scope is specific to web applications.\n",
    "   - It creates a new instance of the bean for each HTTP request.\n",
    "   - The bean instance is available only within the scope of that particular request.\n",
    "   - This scope is suitable when you want to create objects that are tied to a particular request \n",
    "    and should not be shared across requests.\n",

    "Spring beans to meet the specific needs of your application, whether it's maintaining state, sharing\n",
    "resources, or providing independent instances."

    "Autowiring is a feature provided by the Spring Framework that automatically resolves dependencies \n",
    "between beans. Instead of manually configuring the dependencies in the Spring configuration files, \n",
    "autowiring allows the Spring IoC container to automatically inject the required dependencies into\n",
    "beans based on certain rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "The different modes or types of autowiring in Spring are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. No Autowiring:\n",
    "   - This is the default mode when no autowiring is specified explicitly.\n",
    "   - In this mode, dependencies are not automatically resolved by the container.\n",
    "   - Dependencies must be manually configured in the Spring configuration files using constructor-arg,\n",
    "property, or setter tags.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. By Name:\n",
    "   - In this mode, the container matches beans by their names.\n",
    "   - The names of the beans and the properties of the dependent beans must match.\n",
    "   - If a bean with a matching name is found, it is injected as a dependency.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. By Type:\n",
    "   - In this mode, the container matches beans by their types.\n",
    "   - The type of the dependency must match or be a sub-type of the required dependency.\n",
    "   - If exactly one bean of the required type is found, it is injected as a dependency.\n",
    "   - If multiple beans of the required type are found, an exception is thrown.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. By Constructor:\n",
    "   - This mode is similar to autowiring by type, but it applies specifically to constructor arguments.\n",
    "   - The container looks for beans of compatible types and injects them into the constructor arguments\n",
    "    based on the parameter types.\n",
    "   - If multiple beans of the required type are found, an exception is thrown.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Autodetection:\n",
    "   - This mode allows the container to automatically determine the appropriate autowiring mode based on \n",
    "the presence of certain annotations, such as `@Autowired`, `@Inject`, or `@Resource`, on the dependency \n",
    "fields or setter methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Autowiring can be specified at the bean level using the `autowire` attribute in the Spring configuration \n",
    "file or at the individual property or constructor argument level using annotations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of autowiring mode depends on the specific requirements of the application and the desired level\n",
    "of control over dependency resolution. Each autowiring mode provides a different way to automatically\n",
    "resolve and inject dependencies, simplifying the configuration and reducing manual wiring efforts in \n",
    "the Spring application."

    "In the Spring Framework, the lifecycle of a bean in a Spring Bean Factory or ApplicationContext\n",
    "container consists of several stages, from instantiation to destruction. Understanding the bean \n",
    "lifecycle is crucial for performing custom initialization and destruction logic or integrating \n",
    "with certain Spring features. Here is a brief explanation of the bean lifecycle stages in a Spring\n",
    "Bean Factory or ApplicationContext container:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Instantiation: At this stage, the container creates an instance of the bean. This is usually \n",
    "done using the bean's constructor.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Populate Properties: After instantiation, the container populates the bean's properties either \n",
    "through setter methods or fields injection. This is where the dependencies are injected into the bean.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. BeanNameAware and BeanFactoryAware (Optional): If the bean implements the BeanNameAware or \n",
    "BeanFactoryAware interfaces, the container sets the bean's name and the reference to the BeanFactory.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Pre-initialization (PostProcessBeforeInitialization): At this point, any registered BeanPostProcessors\n",
    "have the opportunity to perform custom initialization logic before the actual initialization of the bean.\n",
    "They can modify the bean or return a proxy object if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Initialization (InitializingBean and init-method): If the bean implements the InitializingBean interface,\n",
    "the afterPropertiesSet() method is called. Additionally, if an init-method is specified in the bean \n",
    "configuration, it is invoked. This is where you can perform custom initialization logic for the bean.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Post-initialization (PostProcessAfterInitialization): After the bean has been initialized, registered \n",
    "BeanPostProcessors can perform additional custom processing on the bean. They can modify or wrap the \n",
    "bean if necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Bean is ready for use: At this stage, the bean is fully initialized and ready for use. It can be accessed\n",
    "and used by other beans or components in the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Destruction (DisposableBean and destroy-method): When the container is shut down or explicitly triggered, \n",
    "the bean's destruction process starts. If the bean implements the DisposableBean interface, the destroy() \n",
    "method is called. Additionally, if a destroy-method is specified in the bean configuration, it is invoked. \n",
    "This is where you can perform custom cleanup logic for the bean, such as releasing resources or closing \n",
    "connections.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that not all stages are mandatory for every bean. Some stages, like implementing \n",
    "the BeanNameAware or BeanFactoryAware interfaces or specifying an init-method or destroy-method, are \n",
    "optional and depend on the specific requirements of the bean.\n",
    "\n",
    "By understanding the bean lifecycle, you can leverage the different stages to customize the initialization \n",
    "and destruction processes of beans, perform additional processing, and integrate with Spring features effectively."
