    "To achieve loose coupling in Java using object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts, you can follow\n",
    "the principle of dependency inversion and apply techniques such as dependency injection and \n",
    "interface-based programming. Here's an explanation of how each concept helps in achieving loose coupling:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):\n",
    "   - The Dependency Inversion Principle suggests that high-level modules should not depend on \n",
    "low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.\n",
    "   - By depending on abstractions rather than concrete implementations, you can achieve loose \n",
    "    coupling between classes.\n",
    "   - This principle promotes the use of interfaces or abstract classes as the type of dependencies,\n",
    "allowing flexibility in implementing different concrete classes without affecting the higher-level modules.\n",
    "   - It enables you to change or extend implementations easily without modifying the dependent classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Dependency Injection (DI):\n",
    "   - Dependency Injection is a design pattern that facilitates loose coupling by injecting dependencies \n",
    "into a class rather than having the class create its dependencies.\n",
    "   - It involves providing dependencies to a class from an external source, such as a framework or a \n",
    "    container, rather than hard-coding them within the class itself.\n",
    "   - By separating the creation and management of dependencies, you can easily replace or modify the \n",
    "dependencies without modifying the class that uses them.\n",
    "   - Dependency injection can be achieved through constructor injection, setter injection, or method injection.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Interface-based Programming:\n",
    "   - Interfaces define contracts or behaviors that classes can implement.\n",
    "   - By programming to interfaces rather than concrete implementations, you achieve loose coupling \n",
    "    between components.\n",
    "   - Classes can depend on interfaces, and different implementations of those interfaces can be used interchangeably.\n",
    "   - This allows for easy substitution of implementations without affecting the code that depends on those interfaces.\n",
    "   - Interface-based programming also promotes code reusability, modularity, and testability.\n",
    "\n",
    "By applying these concepts together, you can achieve loose coupling in your Java code. This leads to \n",
    "code that is more modular, maintainable, and flexible, making it easier to manage changes and adapt\n",
    "to evolving requirements."

    "Encapsulation is an important principle in object-oriented programming and refers to the bundling of \n",
    "data and methods within a class. It provides several benefits in Java:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data Hiding: Encapsulation allows you to hide the internal details of an object and provide controlled\n",
    "access to the data. By declaring variables as private and providing public getter and setter methods, \n",
    "you can control how the data is accessed and modified. This helps maintain the integrity and consistency\n",
    "of the object's state.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Access Control: Encapsulation enables you to enforce access control on class members. By using access\n",
    "modifiers (private, public, protected), you can restrict direct access to certain data and methods. \n",
    "This prevents unauthorized modifications and ensures that only the intended behavior is exposed to \n",
    "external code.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Code Organization and Maintainability: Encapsulation helps in organizing code by grouping related\n",
    "data and methods together within a class. It improves code readability and makes it easier to understand\n",
    "and maintain the codebase. Changes made to the internal implementation of a class do not impact the code\n",
    "using the class, as long as the external interface (public methods) remains consistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Code Reusability: Encapsulation supports code reusability by providing well-defined interfaces. Once a\n",
    "class is encapsulated, it can be easily used in other parts of the program or in other programs without \n",
    "worrying about its internal implementation. This promotes modularity and reduces code duplication.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Flexibility and Evolvability: Encapsulation allows you to modify the internal implementation of a class\n",
    "without affecting the code that uses the class. As long as the public interface remains unchanged, other \n",
    "parts of the program can continue to use the class seamlessly. This makes it easier to enhance and extend\n",
    "the functionality of existing code.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Security: Encapsulation provides a level of security by hiding sensitive data and exposing only the \n",
    "necessary operations through well-defined interfaces. It prevents unauthorized access and modification \n",
    "of internal data, thus enhancing the security of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation plays a crucial role in achieving the principles of abstraction, modularity, and\n",
    "information hiding in Java. It promotes better design, code organization, and maintainability,\n",
    "ultimately leading to more robust and scalable applications."

    "No, Java is not considered a 100% pure object-oriented programming language. While Java is \n",
    "predominantly object-oriented, there are a few factors that contribute to its classification \n",
    "as not being 100% pure object-oriented. Here's why:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Primitive Data Types: Java includes primitive data types such as int, char, boolean, etc., \n",
    "which are not objects. These types are not treated as objects and do not have associated methods\n",
    "or inheritance like objects do.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Static Methods and Variables: Java allows the use of static methods and variables, which are\n",
    "associated with the class itself rather than with specific instances of the class. Static methods\n",
    "can be invoked without creating objects, and static variables are shared among all instances of a\n",
    "class. This deviates from the pure object-oriented concept of encapsulating behavior within objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Wrapper Classes: Java provides wrapper classes (e.g., Integer, Double) to wrap primitive types\n",
    "and treat them as objects. While this allows primitives to be used in object-oriented contexts, \n",
    "it still introduces a distinction between primitives and objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Procedural Programming Features: Java supports procedural programming constructs such as control\n",
    "statements (if-else, loops) and procedural methodologies (top-down decomposition). Although these \n",
    "features are not required to use object-oriented programming, their inclusion in Java signifies a\n",

    "Abstraction is a fundamental concept in Java and object-oriented programming. It involves hiding\n",
    "unnecessary details and exposing only essential features of an object or system. Here are some \n",
    "advantages of abstraction in Java:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Simplifies Complex Systems: Abstraction allows you to represent complex systems or entities in a\n",
    "simplified manner. By focusing on the essential features and hiding implementation details, you can\n",
    "manage the complexity and make it easier to understand and work with the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Enhances Code Readability and Maintainability: Abstraction improves code readability by providing\n",
    "a high-level view of a system. It allows developers to understand and work with the system without \n",
    "getting overwhelmed by the low-level details. It also improves code maintainability as changes to the\n",
    "internal implementation can be isolated and hidden behind the abstract interfaces, minimizing the \n",
    "impact on other parts of the codebase.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Encourages Code Reusability: Abstraction promotes code reusability by providing well-defined interfaces.\n",
    "When a class is abstracted, it can be easily used as a blueprint to create multiple derived classes with \n",
    "specific implementations. This saves development time and effort by avoiding code duplication and promotes\n",
    "modular design.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Facilitates Loose Coupling: Abstraction helps in achieving loose coupling between components. \n",
    "By interacting with objects through abstract interfaces rather than concrete implementations, components\n",
    "become decoupled and can be replaced or modified without affecting the rest of the system. This increases\n",
    "flexibility, maintainability, and extensibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Supports Polymorphism: Abstraction is closely related to polymorphism, as it enables the use of \n",
    "abstract types and interfaces to represent a group of related objects. Polymorphism allows you to write \n",
    "code that can work with objects of different concrete classes that implement the same abstract interface.\n",
    "This promotes flexibility and code reuse.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Improves Testability: Abstraction aids in writing unit tests and performing testing in isolation. \n",
    "By focusing on abstract interfaces and providing mock or stub implementations, you can test components \n",
    "independently without relying on the specific details of concrete implementations. This makes testing \n",
    "more manageable and effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, abstraction in Java provides a way to simplify complex systems, enhance code readability and\n",
    "maintainability, promote code reusability and loose coupling, support polymorphism, and improve testability.\n",
    "It is a powerful tool for designing and building scalable, modular, and flexible applications."

    "In this example, the `Shape` class is an abstract class that represents the concept of a shape. \n",

    "\n",
    "The `Circle` and `Rectangle` classes extend the `Shape` class and provide concrete implementations \n",

    "In Java, a final class is a class that cannot be extended or subclassed. When a class is declared as final,\n",
    "it means that it cannot be inherited by other classes. Here are some key points about final classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Preventing Inheritance: By marking a class as final, you prevent other classes from inheriting or \n",
    "extending it. This is useful when you want to ensure that the class's implementation, behavior, or \n",
    "state remains unchanged and cannot be modified through inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Immutability: Final classes are often used in combination with immutable objects. By making a class\n",
    "final, you ensure that its state cannot be modified by any subclass. This guarantees the immutability \n",
    "of objects and promotes thread-safety and consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Security and Design Integrity: Final classes can provide security and protect sensitive operations \n",
    "or algorithms by preventing unauthorized modifications or extensions. Additionally, marking a class as\n",
    "final can help maintain the design integrity of a framework or library by preventing unintentional \n",
    "changes to its core components.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Performance Optimization: Final classes can enable certain performance optimizations. Since a final\n",
    "class cannot be subclassed, the JVM can make certain assumptions and perform optimizations at compile-time \n",
    "or runtime, resulting in potentially improved performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "To declare a class as final in Java, you simply use the `final` keyword before the class declaration. \n",
    "Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "final class FinalClass {\n",
    "    // Class implementation\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `FinalClass` is marked as final, indicating that it cannot be subclassed. \n",
    "Any attempt to extend or subclass the `FinalClass` would result in a compilation error.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's worth noting that while a final class cannot be subclassed, it can still use inheritance itself \n",
    "by extending other classes. Additionally, final methods and final variables can also be used within \n",
    "a final class."
